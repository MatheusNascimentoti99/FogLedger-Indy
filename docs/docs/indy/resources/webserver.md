## Webserver Von Network

### Introduction

This component allow to run a webserver of Von Network. It is based on [BCGOV/von-network](https://github.com/bcgov/von-network). It is a docker image that has a webserver useful to make requests to the ledger and to check the status of the nodes.

### How to use

To use this component, you need to add the following container to your experiment:

```python
Container(
    name='webserver',
    dimage='larsid/fogbed-indy-webserver:v1.0.2-beta',
    port_bindings={8000: 80, 6543: 6543},
    ports=[8000, 6543],
    environment={
        'MAX_FETCH': 50000,
        'RESYNC_TIME': 120,
        'WEB_ANALYTICS': True,
        'REGISTER_NEW_DIDS': True,
        'LEDGER_INSTANCE_NAME': "fogbed",
        'LEDGER_SEED': "000000000000000000000000Trustee1",
        'GENESIS_FILE': "/pool_transactions_genesis"
    }
)
```

GENESIS_FILE: path to the genesis file. It is the file that contains the information of the ledger. It is generated by the IndyBasic component and you can pass it to the webserver.

LEDGER_SEED: it is the SEED used to identify the ledger. You need to use the same SEED that you used to generate the DID and verkey in the `trustees_path`.
